## Templates, Concepts and traits

The common thing between these three words is that they all are
_programming ideas_ and not (perhaps) related to any language feature.
If you want, it's the kind of ideas that know live in the soul of
the modern programming.

If `templates` and `concepts` are a similar in the sens that it allow
the user to do some _meta programming_, `traits` are an idiomatic system
to (and I quote <u> _Bjarn Stroustrup_ </u>) carry informations used by
another object to determine _policy_ or _implementation details_.

## About templates

In C++, templates are very common in the standard library. Even if it
tends to be replaced with concepts, you have probably already seen one
in your programmer life.

It's all about genericness, if you're building a library, you probably
want that the user could use it with any kind of input. If your library
is doing an abstract sequence of operations with the input, there is no
reasons to limit the client to a specific _Class_.

Note that there is some cases where you precisely **want** to be
specific. For example when you build a lib with physic's function, you
certainly want to introduce the specification of types like `Hz`, `km`.
You can so remotely introduce some rules of calculations and
assignations. It's an example but I'm sure there can exist a lot of
reason to don't use generics programming's tools.

Unsurprisingly, the templates takes the form of `< T >` in many
languages. I'll not go into details of the pattern because I'm sure you
can google it if you don't know what is it.

## About concepts

Hmf... ðŸ˜¬ In practice, concepts are very C++ oriented. But it introduce
the idea of _Constraints_ that you cannot have with just templates!
Basically, it move the resolution of the template very early in the
compilation and give a flavour to the user to understand why the type
doesn't match with the library.

In other words:

- with templates, you describe the constraints of the library in the
    documentation (the latest thing you read)
- with concepts, you let the compiler saying the constraints in a nice
    format ðŸ™…

## And the traits

Here is the bridge between Rust and C++ for the meta programming part.
In Rust, traits are used to describe both _Constraints_ and
_implementation details_, where in C++, you need to do a mix of all the
ideas of that article.

Now, a basic example of an almost _word for word translation_. You can
decline it with any algorithm, nevertheless, I'm going to show how to do
the famous `ToString` traits constraints.

```rust
// Declared in the standard library at std::string;
// Let user carry on the implementation for their own structures as `A`
// pub trait ToString {
// 	fn to_string(&self) -> String;
// }

/// Structure defined in the user program
struct A {
	// parameters
};

/// Implementation of the trait `ToString` for local structure `A`
impl ToString for A {
	fn to_string(&self) -> String {
		// implementation
	}
}
```

In rust, most of traits are already declared in the standard library
because it's very idiomatic to work with. Note that as for a C++
parallel, the implementation for `A` isn't _inside_ `A`. It can, for
some reason, being implemented in another file that we would import if
we need `A` to implement the trait!

The library would constrain the used type to implement `ToString` like
that:

```rust
pub fn foo(obj: impl ToString) {
	println!("{}", obj.to_string());
}
```

So what is the C++ equivalent to the paradigm? First you need to declare
yourself the trait. Because C++ is not oriented like that and sometime
(I don't understand why) people discourage to do it that way. If you
have got an idea please comment the post!

```cpp

// That is declared in our library, it hasn't to be a part of the client
// code!
// template<T>
// struct trait_to_string<T> {
// 	std::string to_string(const T& self);
// }

struct A {
	// parameters
}

struct trait_to_string<A> {
	std::string to_string(const A& self) {
		// implementation
	}
}
```

OK, so we are here with a `trait_to_tring` that replace the standard in
Rust. And the structure `trait_to_string<A>` that implement the trait.

You've noticed that we already use templates here in _C++_, and not in
_Rust_. It's because, behind the hood in _Rust_ we are doing the same thing
(but in earlier in the compilation).

Now, we need to constrain the client to use our library with only data
that implement our trait `ToString-like`. We will use... _Concepts_!!
