# üåç Hello, World!

This is the first post on this tech blog.

We had been thinking of creating a blog for a few years, realizing that we had not finalized most of what we started coding.

Several people at *Cappuccino* filled a lot of backup discs with unfinished experiments, keeping with then the idea that they still needed to improve them.

So this is the attempt to start dusting all this old stuff, to show the best ones, to free us from it, and give us the time to start new ideas!

We also want to share them because, if the artistic intent or technical purpose is more or less obvious, we think most of them have some pedagogical value. After all, they share the mistakes we make while learning, creating, or trying to build solid things.
